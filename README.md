## 💻 Description <a name="description"></a>

This is a history-themed project which with the help of linked lists and Grey's code gives the user the opportunity to create, read, update, and delete historical events. The program currently has historical events which occurred on Bulgarian soil and involved Bulgarian tribes. But we intend on expanding it in the future so that it includes historical events which occurred outside the Bulgarian borders.
